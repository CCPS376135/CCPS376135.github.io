       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <P>What I am working towards in my personal life is getting my grades up and focusing on school so I could have a bright future and accomplish the things I want to do in life. On a more professional level I am working to become a dentist the experiences that led me here was my cousin being a dentist and I found it interesting and decided I wanted to be a dentist when I grow up how I'm working towards these goals is by trying to improve my grades and get good test scores and continue to learn about being a dentist so I can get into dental school. the values I consider most necessary for my success being able to stay focus be smart and making minimal mistakes also being a good student and having good grades. short term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future is graduate and walk the stage with everyone in my grade. the character traits I want to be most known for is being out going creative and a good person. the achievements I want to be known for is being successful in whatever I do when I grow up.</p>
